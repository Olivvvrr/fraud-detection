# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains various features related to transactions, and the goal is to classify each transaction as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as transaction amount, transaction type, and other relevant information. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

## Model
A Random Forest classifier is used for this project. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The model achieved the following results on the test dataset:
- Accuracy: 95%
- Precision: 92%
- Recall: 90%
- F1-score: 91%

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Olivvvrr/fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fraud-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis and results:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fraud-detection.ipynb
   ```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques for fraud detection. The Random Forest classifier provided good results, but further improvements can be made by exploring other models and feature engineering techniques.

## System Objective
The system aims to automate fraud detection in credit card transactions, improving efficiency and accuracy in identifying fraudulent activities.

## Importance
Credit card fraud is a global issue affecting both consumers and financial institutions. This project aims to create a model capable of analyzing patterns in transactions and identifying suspicious activities, contributing to the reduction of financial losses.

## Why is this project relevant?
### Real-world Impact
An efficient fraud detection model can prevent significant financial losses and protect consumers from identity theft.

## Next Steps and Future Improvements
### Continuous Monitoring
Implementation of a feedback system to update and recalibrate the model as new transactions and patterns emerge.

### Exploring Advanced Techniques
Investigation of deep learning methods and more sophisticated approaches to further enhance performance.

### Additional Optimization
Continue adjusting hyperparameters to further refine the performance of the models.

### Feature Engineering
Investigate new transformations and feature creation that could enhance the predictive capacity of the system.

### Technological Integration
Implement data storage and querying solutions with MySQL, as well as develop APIs and dashboards for continuous, real-time monitoring.

Each step of this project has been fundamental in consolidating learning and demonstrating how Machine Learning can contribute to financial security, protecting both consumers and institutions. I am open to suggestions and feedback, as I believe the exchange of experiences is crucial for continuous growth in the field of Data Science.
